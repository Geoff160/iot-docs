= Podman Container Support

Fedora IoT has excellent support for container-focused workflows.
Containers provide for separation of OS updates from application updates, as well as allow testing and deployment of different versions of applications.
Fedora IoT uses Podman, a daemonless container engine to develop, download, manage, and run containers to support your home assistant, industrial gateways, or data storage and analytics.

With `podman`, images and containers can be managed and used by a non-privileged user.
Commands are very similar to those used with `docker`.

Show the version of podman and other configuration settings:

----
$ podman info
----

Run as a user, the storage location is under the `~/.local/share/containers` directory.
You can customize podman with files in the  `~/.config/containers` directory.
// storage.conf is one. verify which config file or dir is needed.

Run as root, the storage location is defined in the '/etc/containers/storage.conf' file and defaults to '/var/run/containers/storage'.

----
$ sudo podman info
----

Any of the `podman` commands have help available for several levels of commands.

Show all the commands available:

----
$ podman --help
----

Show the options for the pull command:

----
$ podman pull --help
----

Some commands have other sub commands.
Show the options for the image command:

----
$ podman image --help
----

To show more specific options, keep adding commands before the help request.
Show the options for listing images:

----
$ podman image ls --help
----
